# PyTorch

- open-source machine learning library
- developed by Facebook's AI Research lab
- Tensor computation (multi-dimensional arrays similar to NumPy)
- designed to integrate seamlessly with Python

# Getting started

1. pip install torch torchvision
2. Create custom Dataset class
3. Use the DataLoader from PyTorch to batch and shuffle the data.


# Nett to know

- Dunder methods: def __len__(self):
- Dunder methods allow me to define behaviour for built-in operatiions and functions in a class.
